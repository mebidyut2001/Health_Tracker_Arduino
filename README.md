# Real-Time Health Monitoring System

## Overview
This project aims to develop a real-time health monitoring system using IoT. The system monitors vital health parameters like SpO2, pulse rate, and body temperature, and displays the data on a mobile application.

## Hardware Components
- **Arduino Nano:** Central microcontroller.
- **MAX30100 Sensor:** Measures SpO2 and pulse rate.
- **DHT11 Sensor:** Measures body temperature.
- **Bluetooth Module HC-05:** For wireless communication.

## Software Components
- **Mobile Application:** Developed using Java and Kotlin.
- **Firebase:** Used for user authentication and data storage.
- **XML:** Used for app layout design.

## Features
- Real-time monitoring of SpO2, pulse rate, and body temperature.
- Bluetooth communication between Arduino and mobile app.
- Firebase authentication and data storage.
- Comparative analysis with existing devices, achieving 95% accuracy.

## How It Works
1. **Data Collection:** Sensors connected to the Arduino collect health data.
2. **Data Transmission:** Data is sent to the mobile app via Bluetooth.
3. **Data Visualization:** The app displays real-time health data.
4. **Data Storage:** Health data is stored securely in Firebase.
5. **Accuracy Verification:** Data compared with commercial devices to ensure 95% accuracy.
